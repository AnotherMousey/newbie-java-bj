## How the game works
The rules are simple: 
- The closest one that has a score of less than or equal to 21 wins. 
- The Ace card can be 1 or 11 points. 
- The Jack, Queen, and King card worth 10 points
- The total points of a hand is the sum of the value of the cards on the hand. The Ace card value will be determined by the value that's more beneficial to the hand: if the ace is valued at 11 and the hand doesnt bust, then it will be valued at 11, else at 1.
## The game phases
### The initial phase
This phase will occur once the game starts. You and the dealer both will be given 2 cards from the initial deck. Your 2 will be revealed, but only the dealer's first card will be revealed. The dealer will deal him 2 card first, then it's the player's turn.

Then the player will place a bet. The minimum value of a bet is the amount of chips you currently have divided by 10. The game will end when the player have no chips left. 

You can tip the dealer at the beginning of every round.
### Player's turn
You take turn to hit a card or stand. Your turn will end as soon as you call a stand.
### Dealer's turn
The dealer will begin to reveal the second card. If his total points is larger than 17, he will be forces to stand. Else he will be forced to hit.
### Compare
- If you are not busted and have more points than the dealer or the dealer is busted, you will win and obtain double the amount of chips you bet. 
- If you are busted or you have less points than the dealer, you will not obtain anything.
- If you and the dealer draws, you will obtain the amount of chips you bet.
### Special rules
- If you get a BlackJack, aka get 21 on the first 2 cards, you will get double the amount of chips you bet, but if the dealer get a BlackJack, you will lose double amount of chips you bet. You can avoid this by call a forfeit before the dealer's turn starts. If you suspect that the dealer has a BlackJack, you can call this before the dealer's turn. But if your call is wrong, you will be penalized twice the amount of chips you bet. If both the dealer and the player get a BlackJack, you will be given back the amount of chips you bet and the round ends. 
- If you get a flush, aka draw 5 cards and the total points does not exceed 21, you will get double amount of chips you bet and that round ends.
